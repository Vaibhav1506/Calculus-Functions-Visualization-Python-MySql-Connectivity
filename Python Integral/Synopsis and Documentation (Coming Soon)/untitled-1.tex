\section{Introduction}

Calculus - a remarkable study as well as an important field present in Mathematics. It is basically a branch of mathematics that explores the concepts of change and motion. It provides a powerful set of tools and techniques for understanding and analyzing how things vary and evolve. Developed independently by Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, calculus has since become a fundamental part of mathematics and science and that's why we have tried to represent quite a small part of it in a high - level , general purpose, multi - paradigm programming language known as Python.
